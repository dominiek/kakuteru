        <p>When integrating with other web services, there are often shortcomings in third-party API’s. One of the most common ones I’ve had to deal with is the lack of JSON+callback support. To circumvent this problem, I wrote a tool that can use an API’s XML calls to do the same trick.</p>

        <p>JSON+callback allows you to do loose integrations in Javascript, requiring no development on the server-side of things. This is really useful if you for example, quickly want to fetch Lastfm’s track information and render a player, like on this Kakuteru page. Lastfm didn’t support JSON+callback support in their API until recently. After a lot of whining by developers, they finally dadded support.</p>

        <p>Still, services like Imeem, don’t support the JSON callback yet. So for those service, you can use this tool. Basically, it is a Adobe Flash based converter (written in ActionsScript 3) that converts the XML to a JSONML compatible Javascript Object (JSON).</p>

        <p>All you have to do is put a swf_to_json.swf and a swf_to_json.js file in your codebase, and use simple Javascript syntax to do remote calls.</p>
