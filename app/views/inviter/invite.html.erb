Hi!

Hi <%= @invite.name%>,

You signed up for an early BETA of Kakuteru. You're one of the lucky few to give this service it's first spin!

Get started here: http://kakuteru.com?invite_code=<%= @invite.code %>

Kakuteru is a fully customizable lifestreamer that tries to ride the waves of the ever interconnected and semantic web. Right now it uses FriendFeed as an aggregation backend, but it also provides custom integrations like for example Dopplr for your travel schedule. 

The service is still in it's early stage, but any feedback is welcome over at http://kakuteru.uservoice.com/.

Kampai! (cheers)
